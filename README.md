React Fundamental in ten lessons -- 10 essential basics are all you need to get started with React.

[Part 2](https://github.com/ApolloTang/react-redux-todo-app-demo/tree/master/part-02-todos-no-redux)
With what you have learned in part 1, you can start building a simple todo list app like this one.

[Part 3](https://github.com/ApolloTang/react-redux-todo-app-demo/tree/master/part-03-todos-w-filter-no-redux)
Continue from part 2, a filter for complete/incomplete todo items is added.

Same as part 3 but this time we build it with Redux.  The filter setting is read from router.

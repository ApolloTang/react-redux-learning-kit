# react-tutorial

Each folder is a lesson. In each lesson folder run ```yarn``` to install dependencies:

```sh
cd <lesson-dir>
yarn
```

Then pin up webpack dev server, where it is served at ```localhost:8888```.

```sh
yarn dev -- --open
```

In the above, the ```-- --open``` in the arguments will launch the browser for you.
